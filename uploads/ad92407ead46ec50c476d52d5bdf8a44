ARCO is a funny typography, with rounded edges, with more than 80 characters, its alphabets in uppercase.

This typeface is free for personal and commercial use. It would be very comfortable to share your work with me using this typeface.

I want to thank my friend Denis Ignatov for adding new characters and solving the problems he was having in OSX.
